>As you can imagine, the “thirst for first” led to a significant number of ridiculous bug reports. If a tester could reasonably defend a bug report as valid, then it counted in their statistics, and made them look like a useful member of their team. My impression was that promotions and raises were directly linked to these statistics.

In the past I've been interacting with Quality Assurance for Software Development also, and this is a dangerous game they play. Testing shouldn't be just about finding bugs, it's also about improving the quality of the application.
