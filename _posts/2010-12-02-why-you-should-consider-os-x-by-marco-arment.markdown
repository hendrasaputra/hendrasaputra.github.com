An old post by Marco Arment, founder of Instapaper. Although this is an old post, but all the things Marco said here is still true. This is why I've replaced all my machine with Apple hardware.

Let&rsquo;s start with hardware. Sure, it&rsquo;s cheap, but PC hardware is crappy. It&rsquo;s badly designed, it looks tacky, quality control sucks, and it flakes out too often. I can&rsquo;t even begin to count the hours I spent in high school and college screwing around with my (or my friends&rsquo;) PC hardware, trying to get custom hardware combinations to work properly together. And just try to find a PC case that looks decent <em>and</em> is comfortable to work in.
The software world is much more divided. The quality of OS X, and its third-party software, absolutely blows away anything on Windows. The difference is huge.

Mac software follows design principles that you rarely see in Windows:
* Incredible attention to detail
* Simple, clean interfaces
* Justified, focused feature design (no &ldquo;kitchen sink&rdquo; apps)
* Respect for the user&rsquo;s time (no stealing focus, no unnecessary prompting)
* Respect for the user&rsquo;s intelligence (no &ldquo;we&rsquo;re protecting you from this choice&rdquo;)
* High quality (if it says it will do this and work this way, it will)

**We don&rsquo;t use Macs and Mac software because of the eye candy. We use them because of the design.** Design and eye candy are very different &mdash; design is a combination of how it looks, what it does (and doesn&rsquo;t do), and how it works.

Use a Mac for 6 months, and you&rsquo;ll wonder why you ever used anything else.
