****It's 2016****. I'm not planning to make any big resolution this year, as big resolution usually will never become something real. So this year I'm just going to start small and make changes in my habit. This is a part of that, I'm setting myself a goal to write regularly with small target of 100 words per post. I think that is not a goal that is hard to achieve, but it can be expanded from that, next week it might become 200 words per post. Also to write as if I'm writing for myself, what would I read out there on the internet. What would interest me, instead of thinking what would interest other first.
