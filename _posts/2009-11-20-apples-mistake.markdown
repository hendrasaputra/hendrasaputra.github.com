Another great essay by Paul Graham, in it he argue that until now Apple doesn't realize all the App Store rejection is actually hurting them deep. I especially like the Star Wars analogy he put into his article in a company to developer relationship, because its so true.

>Should Apple care what people like me think?  What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users? There are a couple reasons they should care.  One is that these users are the people they want as employees.  If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you.  That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s.  Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there.  It seemed like selling out.  When people from Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having gone over to the dark side.  But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired.  It was the people they never got.  And you know who got them?  Google and Apple.  If Microsoft was the Empire, they were the Rebel Alliance. And it's largely because they got more of the best people that Google and Apple are doing so much better than Microsoft today.
