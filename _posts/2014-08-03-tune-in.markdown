Sometimes a great tunes of music just inspire you to write
Today its REM with their acoustic tune just makes me want to write
Kids are playing outside before the sun goes down
My sweetheart is not home yet from her breakaway

And here I am, alone
Accompanied by REM great acoustic tune, feeling like bursting my heart out.

It’s funny how music has been a bookmark of our life
Do you remember the time when we were young
I remember it every time Green Day, Nirvana or Rancid is playing around
We use to punk it out in the garage just like those band
Having fun was so much easier back then, can’t we just be that young
That optimistic, that cheerful every day of our life
Having lots and lots of energy to run, play, jam, falling in love
