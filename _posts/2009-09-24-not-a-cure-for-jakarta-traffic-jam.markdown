I am amazed by this city policy maker. How many more obscure untested solutions they want to test on this city. Don't they remember early school policy they just publish? How ridicule is that? ERP I think would not be a solution to traffic jam problem in Jakarta. They would just delay/move the traffic from one area to another area. Kind of like 3-in-1 policy. I propose the government rejuvenate Jakarta public transportation with brand new busses while still providing a low cost, comfortable public transportation. Optimize train routes and add more stations and railway. From personal experience people still buy motorcycle and car because there is no comfortable and cheap alternatives provided.
