I decided during this holiday time to move my blog engine again from Ghost to Jekyll. The migration process itself is quite easy, since everything in ghost can be accessed from ghost.db and mostly are in Markdown anyway. Mostly I used standard documentation available on [Jekyl website](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/migrations/)

I'm going to re-utilized my hosting currently in Digital Ocean for other project, probably trying out MongoDB or Redis.
