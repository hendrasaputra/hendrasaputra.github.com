Sometimes you can’t help but look back, look back and thinking whether you have made all the right decisions. Change is never easy. Especially when you are uprooting your life and they lives of those that matter to you. There is never a certain answer whether you’ve made the correct or wrong choices even if you’ve calculated all you’re moves. Only God knows and time will tell. What you can do is only to keep giving your best. Make the best and hope that good will come your way.

The hardest thing about changes is that it will create a lot of uncertainties. New rhythm, new surprises, new problems to deal with. It is a lot more to work on, but it is never boring. But because it create uncertainties, there is always that feeling of fear. Fear of failure, fear of not being able to make it right. What can you do to fight those fears? Pray? Cry? Work hard? What if you’ve done all of those but you’re still feeling that fear?

There is no one right answer, so I guess I’ll just try and make the best of what I can, work as hard as I can, praying and hoping that everything will turn out ok.
